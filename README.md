## Creating a Professional Website for Employment Opportunities

Created this website to showcase to employers my skills, past projects, and current ones.  The more I learn, the more I will update this webpage
in order to keep it current with my skillset.

This website contains an about me section (called Fun Facts), images with links to my past projects, my contact information, and soon this 
website will have much more.
